# Rubik's Cube Simulator, in Python, from scratch

The goal of this project is to create a simulator of a standard 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube that runs entirely in Python with no outside code. In addition to that, a 3d rendering library will be used to display the cube. (Github Copilot will be used, but as a general rule, I only include code I understand and could come up with myself; that is, I use Copilot as a tool, not as a replacement for the heavy lifting.)
